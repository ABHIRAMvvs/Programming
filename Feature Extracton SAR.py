# Here's the pseudocode for feature extraction of Sentinel 1 images using the Scikit-Image library:

# Step 1: Import the necessary libraries
# Step 2: Load the Sentinel 1 image dataset
# Step 3: Convert the image to grayscale
# Step 4: Apply a Gaussian filter to the image
# Step 5: Compute the texture features of the image using a texture filter, such as the GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix)
# Step 6: Extract relevant features from the computed texture features
# Step 7: Save the extracted feature dataset

# Here's the Python code for the feature extraction of Sentinel 1 images:

# ```python
# Import the necessary libraries
from skimage import io
from skimage.filters import gaussian
from skimage.feature import greycomatrix, greycoprops
import numpy as np

# Load the Sentinel 1 image dataset
image = io.imread('sentinel1_image.tif')

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray_image = np.mean(image, axis=2)

# Apply a Gaussian filter to the image
gaussian_image = gaussian(gray_image, sigma=1)

# Compute the texture features of the image using the GLCM
glcm = greycomatrix(gaussian_image, distances=[5], angles=[0], levels=256, symmetric=False, normed=True)

# Extract relevant features from the computed texture features
contrast = greycoprops(glcm, 'contrast')[0][0]
dissimilarity = greycoprops(glcm, 'dissimilarity')[0][0]
homogeneity = greycoprops(glcm, 'homogeneity')[0][0]

# Save the extracted feature dataset as a CSV file
np.savetxt('sentinel1_features.csv', [contrast, dissimilarity, homogeneity], delimiter=',')
```

# In this code, we use the Scikit-Image library to perform feature extraction on Sentinel 1 image dataset. We first load the image dataset and convert it to grayscale. We then apply a Gaussian filter to the image to reduce noise. 

# We then use the GLCM texture filter to compute the texture features of the image, which includes contrast, dissimilarity, and homogeneity. These features are then extracted and saved in a CSV file for further analysis.
